This is my app, involving randomly selecting cocktails for you. Unless if you don't want to play around and prefer to type in the name of your favorite cocktail, that's an option too 😁 

It is based on free API. The tools I used to write this application are:
- cubit, 
- dio, 
- json_serializable,
- freezed, 
- get_it 
- injecteble.

Additionally, I wrote unit tests.

I hope you love it and cheers 🍻 ❤️
